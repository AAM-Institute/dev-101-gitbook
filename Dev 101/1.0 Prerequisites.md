## (OS, Browser, running in a VM) [0-6 hours]

This is for absolute beginners who may not have much technical knowledge. We need to get everyone on the same page with at least a system that can run their programs and view the results.



Via TOP:

> **If you are already using MacOS, Ubuntu, or [an official flavor of Ubuntu](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuFlavors) as your operating system and have Google Chrome as an installed browser, you can skip this section.**

> We can only support the operating systems indicated above. Our instructions have been tested with MacOS, Ubuntu, and official flavors of Ubuntu. We do not recommend installing an OS that is only based on Ubuntu (like Mint, Pop!_OS, ElementaryOS, etc). 
  

-   Lesson: Teach students what an Operating system is and the various flavors (Windows, Mac, Linux)
    
-   Lesson: Teach students what a browser is and the various flavors (Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox, Mobile browsers)
    

  

In order for the course to go smoothly, we need to remove as many differences between students machines, so that we don’t need to deal with conflicts on a student’s machine (different os/program/language versions, various browser issues, software requirements)

  

For this reason, a VM or Virtual Machine is recommended. A VM is a completely separate, isolated OS running (or emulated) inside of your normal OS. It allows you to install and run programs in a protected sandbox, without having any effect on your current programs and data.

The odin project walks through setup of a UNIX OS **Windows users will need to follow these instructions**

### Windows Prerequisites (install Ubuntu Linux)

> If you are not using Windows, you may skip this section.

Windows is NOT a UNIX OS, that means that the command prompt in W is totally different that Linux or Mac terminal/command-line.

  

Recently, M$ has implemented a software layer to run Linux inside W OS. This is an alternative to running Ubuntu within a VM. 

  

With a VM, your OS/data/programs are isolated from each other and cannot interact. If you screw up your VM system, or encounter malicious software, you can just delete/recreate the VM

  

With WSL, you install a separate OS that runs alongside W in parallel (at the same time). The Linux OS will have full access to all of your windows files and you must be responsible when running commands.

  

The advantage of running in WSL will be speed and OS interoperability. If the student wishes to install Ubuntu in WSL rather than a VM, they can do so.

-   WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
    

  

Dual-booting or directly installing an operating system is beyond the scope of these courses, however it will offer the highest performance, speed, and interoperability, while keeping some separation between your data

  

-   Lesson: We should write some tips on switching from W to Unix, like case-specific file-system, slashes go “/” not “\”, drives are not mapped to letters (C:\), 
    

  

## 1.2 UNIX command-line

The command-line is a powerful and dangerous tool, and you should never enter commands from sources you don’t trust, as some pranks encourage running `sudo rm -rf /*`, which will wipe your entire system and data.

sudo - “Superuser Do,” runs the proceeding command with full root/administrator privileges

rm - “Remove,” a Unix command to delete files from the system

-rf - Flags follow a command and can come in a few forms, “-r -f”, “--recursive –force”, “-rf” all have the same meaning

-r - Recursive, meaning the remove command will delete directories and loop into the child directories to delete files as well

-f - Force, meaning the remove command will ask for no confirmations before deleting files

/ - a “/” means “root directory,” or the highest folder within the file system. On Windows OS this is usually `C:\`. This tells the remove command from which directory to begin deleting files

* - an asterisk* is a wildcard character that tells the remove command to match any file/folder name. It can be used with partial strings like `wedding*` to match “wedding-photo.jpg” file and “wedding photos” folder or “*.jpg” to match any JPG image

  

Project: Using the command-line, change directories (`cd`) to your home folder (`/home/<username>` or `~`) and create a new directory (`mkdir`) named “Repos”.

  

Change directories into the newly-created “Repos” folder and create a new file (`touch`) named “hello.txt”. Open the file using `nano` and add the word “world” to the file contents. Save (`ctrl-O`) and exit (`ctrl-X`)

  
  

## 1.3 Version Control - Git (AKA a time machine for your files)

#### Installing Git
How to install Git for Mac/Linux. I need to go through the installation process step-by-step to verify it works properly.

#### Intro to Git
[https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-git-basics](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-git-basics)

This TOP course works through the main features of Git, setting up a Github account, creating a new repository. It is thorough and covers many issues students may have. After this course students should have a Github account


## 1.4 Interactive Development Environment (IDE): Visual Studio Code

#### Installing VSCode

-   VSCode for Web (Online VSCode, https://vscode.dev/)
-   Desktop Install Video: [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics) (8 min)  


## 1.5 NodeJS

## 1.5 PROJECT

Use the command-line, Git, and VSCode to update a repository.

- Create a github account, fork a project, then clone.
- Update the project by adding your name as a contributor to the package.json file.
- Commit to save changes, then push to your new fork.

**Bonus: Create a pull request to the project**
