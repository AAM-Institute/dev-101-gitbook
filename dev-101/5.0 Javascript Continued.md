# 6.0 Further Development & Tooling

### 6.1 Configuration Files

Configuration files are specific to the language, framework, or application you are working with. The filenames may begin with a `.` , which usually indicates a hidden file.

#### Git

Git configuration files are stored in the `.git` directory. These can include hooks or requirements for code to be committed or pushed.

#### Node

Since we will be working with NodeJS, you'll want to familiarize yourself with [the `package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json) file.

### 6.2 CSS Pre-processors

SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a pre-processor scripting language that will be compiled or interpreted into CSS. **SCSS is the main syntax for the SASS which builds on top of the existing CSS syntax.** CSS is a subset of SCSS, which means that CSS is valid SCSS.

### 6.3 Javascript Bundling

[Why do we use a Javascript bundler?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UWlufSzO4k) (5 min) This is a dead simple explanation to bundling and why it is useful.

For this course we will be using the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to handle bundling our files.

Follow along in [this tutorial](https://codedamn.com/news/javascript/what-is-vite-js) that demonstrates using Vite to bundle a react app.
