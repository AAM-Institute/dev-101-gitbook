# 6.0 Further Development & Tooling

### 6.1 Configuration Files

Configuration files are specific to the language, framework, or application you are working with. They may contain information about the project or its dependencies. The filenames may begin with a `.` , which usually indicates a hidden file/directory.

#### Git

Git configuration files are stored in the `.git` directory. These can include hooks or requirements for code to be committed or pushed.

#### Node

Node comes with a built-in package manager to handle dependencies. `npm` is the Node Package Manager. `yarn` is an `npm` alternative. Since we will be working with NodeJS, you'll want to familiarize yourself with [the `package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json) file.

Once you have Node installed, you can generate a new `package.json` file by running `npm init` within a project directory.



### 6.2 CSS Pre-processors

SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a pre-processor scripting language that will be compiled or interpreted into CSS. **SCSS is the main syntax for the SASS which builds on top of the existing CSS syntax.** CSS is a subset of SCSS, which means that CSS is valid SCSS.

### 6.3 Javascript Bundling & Scaffolding

[Why do we use a Javascript bundler?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UWlufSzO4k) (5 min) This is a dead simple explanation to bundling and why it is useful.

Scaffolding is used to quickly generate a baseline project template from a set of parameters.

For this course we will be using the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to handle bundling and scaffolding our files.

Follow along in [this tutorial](https://codedamn.com/news/javascript/what-is-vite-js) that demonstrates using Vite to bundle a react app.
