# 4.0 Javascript Basics

Now let's jump into Javascript, the programming language of The Web. These next videos give a great intro to adding Javascript to a page and doing basic scripts:

### 4.1 Javascript in HTML

The Odin Project once again has some wonderful JS guides we will use for now

Let's see it in action! [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeFzkC2awTM) demonstrates creating a dynamic shopping cart using Vanilla JS. (45 min)

### 4.2 Developer tools (inspecting JS):

The developer tools can do more than edit HTML and styles, it contains a full-fledged console! [The Odin Project has more to say](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-javascript-developer-tools).

### 4.3 JS in-depth

There's a lot more to Javascript and a Web Developer vs a Web Designer. DOM manipulation is how we interact with the HTML page, and Events are how we know that things have changed (e.g. user interacted with the page).

Errors aren't usually fun to deal with as developers, but through defensive programming and a thorough understanding of how errors are handled, we can make debugging much more pleasant.

### 4.4 NodeJS

Normally, Javascript only runs within a browser. NodeJS is a runtime that allows Javascript to be run anywhere, including as a back-end language on the server.

### 4.5 Project

Let's add some interactivity to our custom webpage using Javascript. Add an image to your page from [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com), then create a refresh button to load a new image.

> [Live Demo](https://aam-institute.github.io/project-003/)

* Create a way to dynamically load a new image onto your page
* Commit your changes to Git.
* Deploy your page to Github Pages

**Bonus:** Create a light and dark mode for your page!
