# 2.0 HTML Basics

**Welcome to Web Dev (continued):**

HTML is the foundation of the web. Check out [this quick video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88QJumITbQA) to get a high level overview of the most important topics. (5 min)

Let's use Codepen to try out writing some basic HTML! Open a new [Codepen instance](https://codepen.io/pen) and follow along with parts of the following, [absolute beginners introduction to HTML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONin3xInlGw) (50min)

I like this because it starts from absolute zero and describes HTML basics in a pretty thorough manner. Follow along with the video and you'll have the ability to create and view your own HTML page on your computer. Once you've completed that, let's reinforce some of what they went over with these additional videos:

* Text/Tags: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItZN6o0ylao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItZN6o0ylao) (5 min)
* Images: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyINBQFpL0o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyINBQFpL0o) (5 min)
* Lists: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fmob-VeAMo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fmob-VeAMo) (5 min)
* Links: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prG3mvho3tU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prG3mvho3tU) (5 min)
* Meta tags

### 2.1 Create your first webpage

Time to create your first web page! Follow along with the below videos on your computer. You may copy the page in the video, or create your own!

**Your first web page**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88QJumITbQA (5 min) This features a Live Reload plugin for VSCode, which is a super helpful tool when developing static pages!

**Basic HTML Elements**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PypMN-yui4Y

**Advanced HTML Elements**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rbo\_HHt5nw

### 2.2 Inspecting HTML/CSS

This is a great (and quick) overview of what the inspector is and why it is useful: [https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-inspecting-html-and-css](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-inspecting-html-and-css)

### 2.3 Intermediate HTML concepts

HTML Basics in VSCode:

* Watch this video and follow along in VSCode: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE) (60 min)

This video re-introduces some concepts, then uses all of the previously-learned knowledge and adds more tags, shows practical uses for the inspector. It could be used in place of all of the above HTML knowledge but I think it works better as a suppliment.

Topics:

* Forms and different input types
* HTML5 tags like header, nav, article,
* CSS in HTML
* JS in HTML
* Inspector

### 2.4 Resources: Where to find help

* MDN Web Docs is a documentation repository and learning resource for web developers. It was started by Mozilla as a unified place for documentation about open web standards and developer guides. [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web)
* W3Schools is _a school for web developers_, covering all the aspects of web development [https://www.w3schools.com/](https://www.w3schools.com/)
* A front-end developer turned blogger writes about common HTML/CSS problems and solutions. Also creator of CodePen. [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/)
* Not all HTML/CSS/JS features are created equal. Certain features (Ex: CSS content-queries) may not be available in certain browsers or devices and therefore will only be seen by a fraction of users to your website. You can see browser support for all features using [https://caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com)
* StackOverflow is the #1 place to ask programming questions and find answers for common programming knowledge. Remember to do proper research beforehand and include any additional information with your question. Ask your question in the appropriate category: [https://stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com)
* The **Manual** - Reading the manual or documentation for the library, framework, or language is often the best way to answer your questions, and experienced devs will look here first if they need answers. It's easy to copy code on SO but the documentation will give you much more insight.

### 2.5 PROJECT

You should now know how to use their IDE, command-line and version control basics, and have the ability to create and view webpages.

* Use Git to create a new repository. You can use the Github UI or `git init` on the command-line.
* Use HTML to create a static webpage: Create your own digital business card or contact card with your name (or nickname), a job title ("awesome web dev!"), and some way to contact you.

#### [Live demo](https://aam-101-html.netlify.app/)

> This was deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for free, try it yourself!

**Helpful information**

* `git add .`
* Adds all of the files in the current directory `.` to git tracking in order to be committed.
* `git commit -am “Commit message for git history”`
* Commits -a (all) of the currently staged/tracked files with the -m (message) “Commit message for git history”

**Bonus:** Include an Image/Avatar on your page!
